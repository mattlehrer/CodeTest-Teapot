  <h1>Code Test - Teapot</h1>
  <p>We'd like to see how you learn about 3D models and rendering.</p>
  <p>You're task is to render the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot">Utah Teapot</a>.</p>
  <p>Learning libraries takes time, so we'd like to keep this as simple as possible with pure javascript.</p>
  <p>Please commit early and often so we can get an idea of how you progressed through this task.</p>
  <p>It should not take more than a day to complete this task. Please let us know if you have any questions.</p>
  <p>If you have extra time you can try any of these enhancements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parse vertex normals and use them to shade the teapot</li>
    <li>Use a perspective projection matrix to render the teapot</li>
    <li>Add keyboard or mouse controls to rotate the teapot</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Good luck!</p>
